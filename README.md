Initial try of porting KTuberling to pure QML

This is a mere testing project for me to learn about OML development.

The original artwork is part of KTuberling and also under the GPLv2. http://www.kde.org/applications/games/ktuberling/

Additional icons are from the Tango icon set available under http://tango.freedesktop.org/Tango_Desktop_Project . These icons are in the public domain.
